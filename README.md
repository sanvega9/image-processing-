# K-Pop Image Scaling

This project demonstrates image scaling techniques using OpenCV and Matplotlib in Python. Specifically, it showcases zooming and scaling down of a K-Pop image. 

## Project Overview

- **Original Image**: The initial image loaded in RGB format.
- **Zoomed Image**: The image is enlarged by a factor of 3 using cubic interpolation.
- **Scaled Image**: The image is reduced to one-third of its original size using area interpolation.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
    ```
    pip install 
    ```
3. Place your image in the specified directory (`./4minute/hyuna/95790_FBac.jpg`).
4. Run the script:
    ```
    python your_script_name.py
    ```

## Example Output

The script generates a plot displaying the original image, the zoomed image, and the scaled image side by side.
